Recently on the MIFATO.com exchange. Upon my signup, I was given a by my standards, a large sum of money. I was assured everything was on the up and up. I only needed to complete my KYC to gain access to my newly found riches.
As part of the aforementioned KYC, it was required I make a deposit of .004 BTC. Despite my apprehensions I proceeded with the deposit. That when was all said and done was received at .00396 BTC. Being just shy of the requirements. 
I was then informed I still did not have access to any of my money. Not even my deposit, due to the wallet being governed by a smart contract. Furthermore until a deposit of the required .004 BTC was made in a single deposit. 
I could not withdraw be refunded or in any way be reimbursed. Now the question of legitimacy is further heightened and as to whether or not deposit a second time. Thanks from an apprehensive Appalachian.
